# xboomx

xboomx is wrapper for dmenu. The goal is to apply sorting commands according to their launch frequency. In other words - if you launch emacs and lxterminal all the time - they will appear in the list of commands first.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sciunto-org/xboomx
cd xboomx
sudo apt-get install suckless-tools # here is instruction for debian. really we need only dmenu
sudo python setup.py install
```

Available via AUR as `xboomx-snilius`.

## Config
The config file is located at `~/.config/xboomx/config.txt`. It is created during the first execution of xboomx.


Here is an alternative content:
```json
{
  "dmenu_params": "-b -i -nb black -nf orange -sb black -p \"#\"",
  "ignorelist": ["X"],
  "complete_offpath": false
}
```

For `dmenu_params` please see the manpages for dmenu.
```sh
man dmenu
```

The `ignorelist` to prevent stuff that is in your path for showing up as suggestions. Like if you type `x` then `X` might show up before `xbmc`.

`complete_offpath` will add everything that's in you ranking database regardless of availability on PATH. This is off by default.
